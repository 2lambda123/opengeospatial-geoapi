Unless otherwise specified in this specification or in the API documentation,
mandatory "getter" methods shall return the requested value unless the value
is missing in which case they shall throw an exception such as `Illegal­State­Exception`.
|===

"Getter" methods (methods which obtain a value from an object)
are documented through annotations in the Javadoc as mandatory or optional.
Mandatory "getter" methods are expected to return the requested value
unless the value is missing in which case they shall throw an exception.
An exception is made to this requirement in the metadata packages
because of the extensive existence of incomplete metadata (<<nil_values>>).
