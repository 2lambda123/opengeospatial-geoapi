=== Conformance Class A

[[test-signatures]]
==== Types and method signatures
[cols=">20h,<80d",width="100%"]
|============================================
|Test id:      | conf/conf-class-a/req-signatures
|Requirement:  | <<req-signatures,req/req-class-a/req-signatures>>
|Test purpose: | Verify that all types and properties in OGC namespace are as published.
|Test method:  | [red yellow-background]#TODO: see below.#
|============================================

[red yellow-background]#TODO: write a Java program verifying signature of all classes and methods in the `org.opengis` namespace.
This verification would be done for the "libraries" target type only, not the "applications" target type.#

[[test-invariants]]
==== Object invariants
[cols=">20h,<80d",width="100%"]
|============================================
|Test id:      | conf/conf-class-a/req-invariants
|Requirement:  | <<req-behavior,req/req-class-a/req-behavior>>
|Test purpose: | All the instances of GeoAPI interfaces shall be valid according to the test validator, whenever a validator exists for the instance type.
|Test method:  | [red yellow-background]#TODO: describe validators.#
|============================================

This does not require that all instances be tested but merely that if the instances were tested,
they would validate.
