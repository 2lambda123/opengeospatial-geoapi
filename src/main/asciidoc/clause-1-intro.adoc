== Introduction

=== Scope

The scope of GeoAPI 3.0.1 is to provide Java interfaces derived from ISO 19103, ISO 19115 and ISO 19111 standards.
The goal of this corrigendum is to make GeoAPI compatible with Jigsaw modules introduced with Java 9.
This goal implies an upgrade of "Units of measurement" dependency from JSR-363 to JSR-385.
