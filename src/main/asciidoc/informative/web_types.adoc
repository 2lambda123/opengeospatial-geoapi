==== Web types
[.reference]_From ISO 19103:2015 §C.3_

ISO 19103 defines the following data types for use in World Wide Web environments.
Those types are often found in XML documents.
GeoAPI maps the ISO types to standard types of the target languages without introducing new interfaces.

===== Departures from ISO model

All ISO 19103 web types extend `CharacterString`.
But it is not the case of equivalent objects provided by the standard Java library.
Consequently a character string can not easily be substituted by an anchor, file name or URI in GeoAPI for Java.
