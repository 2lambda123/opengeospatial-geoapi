[[geometry_departures]]
==== Departures from ISOÂ 19107

===== Convenience
GeoAPI has moved the `DirectPosition` and `Envelope` types from the coordinate sub-package
where they are defined in the ISO 19107 specification up to the `opengis.geometry` package
due to their importance and frequency of use.

===== Union replacement
ISO 19107 defines `Position` as the union of `DirectPosition` and `Point`.
But unions are not allowed in Java.
Instead, GeoAPI defines `Position` as the base interface of both types
so a similar functionality can be achieved with an _"is instance of"_ check.

===== Efficiency
GeoAPI adds the following shortcut methods in the `Envelope` interface.
They are frequently requested information that implementers can often provide
in a more efficient way than forcing users to compute them from lower and upper corners:
`dimension`, `minimum`, `maximum`, `median` and `span`.
