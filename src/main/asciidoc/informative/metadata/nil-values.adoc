==== Nil values

ISO 19115-3 â€“ _XML schema implementation for fundamental concepts_ allows property values to be nil
even when the property is declared mandatory by ISO 19115-1 standard.
In such case, ISO 19115-3 requires to specify why the property is nil.
Nil reasons can be:

[role="compact"]
* *Template:*     the metadata is only a template with values to be provided later.
* *Withheld:*     the value is not divulged.
* *Unknown:*      a correct value probably exists but is not known and not computable.
* *Missing:*      the correct value is not readily available and may not exist.
* *Inapplicable:* there is no value.

GeoAPI does not provide a mechanism for specifying the reason why a property is nil.
Instead, the GeoAPI rules of method return values have been relaxed for the metadata packages.
Elsewhere in GeoAPI, methods which have a mandatory obligation in the specification
must return an instance of the return type and cannot return the Java `null` or Python `None` reference.
However, in the metadata package this rule is relaxed because data sets are encountered so frequently
which have nil values for any of above-cited reasons.
In the GeoAPI metadata packages, methods for mandatory properties should return a valid instance,
but users should be prepared to receive `null` (Java), `None` (Python) or an empty collection.
This modification has been adopted to allow implementations sufficient latitude
about how to handle metadata records with nil values.
Nonetheless, sophisticated implementations can determine if a metadata record conforms with
the ISO 19115-1 specification by inspecting the annotations at runtime (<<UML-introspection>>).
