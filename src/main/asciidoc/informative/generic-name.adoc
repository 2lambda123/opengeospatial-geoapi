==== Name types
[.reference]_From ISO 19103:2015 §7.5_

A `GenericName` is a sequence of identifiers rooted within the context of a namespace.
`NameSpace` defines a domain in which names can be mapped to objects.
For example names could be primary keys in a database table,
in which case the namespace is materialized by the table.
Each storage (XML, shapefiles, netCDF, …) may have their own constraints for names in their namespaces.

`GenericName` is the base interface for all names in a `NameSpace`.
A generic name can be either a `LocalName`, or a `ScopedName` which is an aggregate of
a `LocalName` (the _head_) for locating another `NameSpace` and
a `GenericName` (the _tail_) valid in that name space.
For example if `"urn:​ogc:​def:​crs:​EPSG:​10:​4326"` is a `ScopedName`,
then `"urn"` is the _head_ and `"ogc:​def:​crs:​EPSG:​10:​4326"` is the _tail_.
GeoAPI extends the model by allowing navigation in the opposite direction,
with `"urn:​ogc:​def:​crs:​EPSG:​10"` as the _path_ and `"4326"` as the _tip_.

`TypeName` and `MemberName` are subtypes of `LocalName`
for referencing a type (for example a class) and a member (for example a property in a class) respectively.
All those types are mapped to {supported-languages} classes as below:

[[generic-name-departure]]
===== Departures from ISO model

====== Generalization
GeoAPI extends the ISO 19103 model by adding a (_path_, _tip_) pair in complement to the (_head_, _tail_) pair.
While the _head_ and _tip_ properties carry non-trivial information only inside `ScopedName`,
GeoAPI nevertheless makes them available from the parent `GenericName` interface (not shown in above UML diagram)
with the restriction that they shall return `this` (Java) or `self` (Python) when the name is an instance of `LocalName`.
This generalization makes common operations simpler without the need to check for the exact name interface.

====== Renaming
The ISO 19103 `GenericName.aName` property appears as `toString` in above UML diagram,
but this property should be mapped to the standard mechanism for representing an arbitrary object
as a character string in the target programming language.
In Java this is the `toString()` method;
in Python this is `+__str__+` or `+__repr__+`.
This specification uses the Java method name as it is more readable, but other languages should adapt.
The `aName` and `scopedName` properties in sub-interfaces are replaced by inheritance of `toString` in above UML.

====== Omissions
ISO 19103 defines mapping functions from a name to the object identified by that name:
`getObject()` in `GenericName` and numerous functions in `NameSpace`.
Those functions are not included in GeoAPI interfaces.
Instead we left these mappings to other frameworks, for example _Java Naming and Directory Interface_ (JNDI).
<<JNDI,An example in annex>> shows how some omitted functions can be implemented by JNDI in the Java language.

====== Additions
The `NameFactory` is an extension to allow the construction of instances of these name types
(in GeoAPI, factories are realizations of constructors).
The `GenericName.toFullyQualifiedName()` method is an addition for developer convenience.
All GeoAPI additions on name types carry no new information compared to ISO model.
