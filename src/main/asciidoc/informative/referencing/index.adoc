=== Referencing packages

The GeoAPI referencing packages use the `opengis.referencing` and `opengis.parameter` namespaces
and implement the types defined in the ISO 19111:2007 - _Referencing by coordinates_ specification.
[red yellow-background]#TODO: upgrade to ISO 19111:2019.#
The referencing package also includes the types describing object factories and mathematical transformation operators
defined in the legacy standard OGC 01-009 - _Coordinate Transformation Services_ from 2003.
