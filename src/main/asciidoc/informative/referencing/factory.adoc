==== Factory
[.reference]_From OGC 01-009_

The referencing packages include factory types defined originally in the OGC 01-009 specification.
These object factories define a normalized approach to object instantiation and come in two forms:
subtypes of `ObjectFactory` which instantiate objects by assembling types passed as arguments and
subtypes of `AuthorityFactory` which instantiate objects based on the values of some third party database,
notably those in the EPSG geodetic dataset assembled by the Surveying & Positioning Committee
of the International Association of Oil & Gas producers.
