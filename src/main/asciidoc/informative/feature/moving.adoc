[.reference]_From OGC 18-075 figure 3_

Features often have an attribute of type `Geometry` (ISO 19107).
A sub-type of `Geometry` is `Trajectory` (ISO 19141).
A feature where the geometry is a trajectory is a moving feature.
In addition of time-dependent positions defined by the trajectory,
a moving feature may also have time-dependent attribute values.
Those attributes are represented by the `DynamicAttribute` sub-type.
