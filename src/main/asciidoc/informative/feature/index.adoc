=== Feature packages

The GeoAPI feature package uses the `opengis.feature` namespace
and implements the types defined in the ISO 19109:2015 – _Rules for application schema_ specification.
The main UML materialized by GeoAPI is ISO 19109 figure 5 [red yellow-background]#(TODO: verify)#.
That figure is also reproduced in ISO 19103:2015 figure E.6.

[red yellow-background]#TODO: provide UML and explain the mapping.#
