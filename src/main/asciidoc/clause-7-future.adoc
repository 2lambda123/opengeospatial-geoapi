== Future Work

All Java interfaces in GeoAPI 3.0.2 are identical to GeoAPI 3.0.1,
with only the addition of `module-info` and the upgrade of JSR dependency.
Future GeoAPI versions (3.1 and 4.0) will contain upgrade to latest revisions
of ISO 19103, ISO 19115, ISO 19111 standards,
together with the addition of interfaces for ISO 19109 and 19143 standards.
Addition of Python abstract classes are also explored.
Progress are reported on the https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoapi/projects[projects page on GitHub].
