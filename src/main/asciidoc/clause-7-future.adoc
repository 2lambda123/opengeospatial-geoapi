== Future Work

All Java interfaces in GeoAPI 3.0.2 are identical to GeoAPI 3.0.1,
with only the addition of `module-info.java` and the upgrade of JSR dependency.
More extensive changes are in progress for future GeoAPI versions (3.1 and 4.0):

* Update to latest revisions of OGC/ISO standards:
  ** ISO 19103 (record and generic name)
  ** ISO 19115 (metadata)
  ** ISO 19157 (data quality)
  ** ISO 19111 (referencing by coordinates)

* Addition of interfaces for new OGC/ISO standards:
  ** ISO 19109 (feature schema)
  ** ISO 19143 (filter encoding)

* Addition of Python abstract classes (exploratory work).
* More tests in the conformance test suite.

Progress are reported on the https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoapi/projects[projects page on GitHub].
