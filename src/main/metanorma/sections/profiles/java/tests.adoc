=== Tests suite

The `geoapi-conformance` module contains a number of validators which can be used
in JUnit test cases to test compliance of the objects created in an implementation.
The GeoAPI validators can establish that certain instances are invalid and therefore
can readily be integrated into the test suite of any implementation library.
The following code demonstrates an example which uses the validators to evaluate
an instance object created by the implementation within a unit test.
This test requires the JUnit library, version 4 or later, on the Java Classpath.

[source,java]
-------------
import static org.opengis.test.Validators.*;

public class ValidationTests {
    @Test
    public void testCRS() {
        // The implementation would build this CRS
        CoordinateReferenceSystem crs = ...;
        validate(crs);
    }
}
-------------

If the validation fails, the JUnit library would throw an `AssertionÂ­Error`.
