=== Core data types mapping

The ISO 19103 specification (_Geographic Information – Conceptual schema language_) defines types
which are used as building blocks by the other standards in the 19100 series.
<<ISO19103>> defines Primitive types (§7.2 of that standard), Collection types (§7.3), Enumerated types (§7.4),
Name types (§7.5), Record types (§7.7) and Unit of Measure types (§C.4).
GeoAPI maps these types either to existing types from the {supported-languages} standard libraries or, when needed,
to types defined in the `opengis​.util` package.
That utility package is used by GeoAPI for types defined in the ISO 19103 specification
for which no equivalence is already present in the {supported-languages} standard libraries.

For various practical reasons the mapping from ISO types to programming language types is not a one-to-one relationship.
The mapping actually used is explained below.
Furthermore, not all of the types in ISO 19103 have a mapping defined because the need for these types has not yet appeared,
since they have not yet appeared in any other specification for which GeoAPI defines interfaces.
Such types are listed as "unimplemented" in the tables below.
