=== Feature packages

The GeoAPI feature package uses the `opengis​.feature` namespace
and implements the types defined in the <<ISO19109>> – _Rules for application schema_ specification.
The main UML materialized by GeoAPI is ISO 19109 figure 5 #(TODO: verify)#.
That figure is also reproduced in <<ISO19103>> figure E.6.

#TODO: provide UML and explain the mapping.#
