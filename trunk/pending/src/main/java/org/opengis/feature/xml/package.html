  <BODY>
  Helper classes to model XML content as a
  {@linkplain org.opengis.feature.Feature}, these add no additional modeling power - they
  simply document the best practice.
  
  <p>
  The XML model is similar, but more permissive, then that employed by the feature model.
  In particular two ideas give rise to trouble: ordering constraints (all,sequence,choice)
  and grouping (repeat series of attributes).
  </p>
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>All - modeled as a {@linkplain org.opengis.feature.ComplexAttribute}, contains a colleciton of attributes
  <li>Sequence - modeled as a {@linkplain org.opengis.feature.xml.Sequence}, specifies that
      attributes are returned in a List of attribtues
  <li>Choice - models as a {@linkplain org.opengis.feature.xml.Choice}, specifies attributes are returned in a list of length 1    
  </ul>
  <p>
  To model the concept of anonymous groups of attribtues you will need to explicity model
  this behavior with the above constructs (aka strongly type them), to preserve
  the inline behavior for XPath you can make use of {@linkplain org.opengis.feature.type.ComplexType.isInline}
