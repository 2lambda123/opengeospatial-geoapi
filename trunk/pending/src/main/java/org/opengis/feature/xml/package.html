<BODY>
Helper classes to model XML content as a {@linkplain
org.opengis.feature.Feature}, these add no additional modeling power -
they simply document the best practice.

<p>The XML model is similar, but more permissive, then that employed by
the feature model. In particular two ideas give rise to trouble:
ordering constraints (all,sequence,choice) and grouping (repeat series
of attributes).</p>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>All - modeled as a {@linkplain
	org.opengis.feature.ComplexAttribute}, contains a colleciton of
	attributes
	<li>Sequence - modeled as a {@linkplain
	org.opengis.feature.xml.Sequence}, specifies that attributes are
	returned in a List of attribtues
	<li>Choice - models as a {@linkplain org.opengis.feature.xml.Choice},
	specifies attributes are returned in a list of length 1
</ul>
<p>To model the concept of anonymous groups of attribtues you will need
to explicity model this behavior with the above constructs (aka strongly
type them), to preserve the inline behavior for XPath you can make use
of {@linkplain org.opengis.feature.type.ComplexType.isInline}</p>

<h2>Namespace vs URI
<h2>
<p>This is a real knock down brawl between the XML Schema happy and the
ISO modelers, and where most of the remaining friction in this api
occurs. This is complicated by the fact that a lot of the same words
are used in both places:</p>
<ul>
<li>xsd:schema - maps to a Schema, with lookup by Namespace, targetNamespace used for Name of Schema (and Namespace)
<li>xsd:element - maps to an AttributeType, with TypeName based on targetNamespace + xsd:element name, this TypeName and AttributeType are placed in the Schema for safe keeping and lookup.
<li>xsd:complexType - maps to a ComplexType, with TypeName based on targetNamespace + xsd:element, this TypeName and ComplexType are placed into the Schema
    <ul>
    <li>xsd:element (local) - will be defined with a TypeName based on complexType + element name, this value is not placed into any Schema, a Namespace could be associated with the Type if you want?
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>So lets work out what maps to what: TODO need an example XSD here so we can be explicit
<ul>
	<li>Schema maps (when parsed into the type system) into:
	<ul>
		<li>Schema - aka lookup of types by name, implemened directly as a Map
		of TypeName to AttributeType</li>
		<li>Namespace - holds the TypeNames in a set for you, returned
		directly from Schema.keySet(), has a name based on target namespace</li>
		<li>Name based on targetNamespace
	</ul>
	<li>elments become ComplexType (or FeatureType) depending on mapping:
	<ul>
		<li>ComplexType - defined by elements in the schema with names based
		on the schema uri + element name
		<li>ComplexType
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
