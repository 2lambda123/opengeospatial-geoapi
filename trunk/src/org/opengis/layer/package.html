    Basic unit of geographic information that may be requested as a map from a server. The following is
    adapted from <A HREF="http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=5316">Web Map Service</A>:

    <P ALIGN="justify">Each available map is advertised by a {@link org.opengis.layer.Layer} element in
    the service metadata. Conceptually, each Layer is a distinct entity. However, as a means of classifying
    and organizing layers, and as a means of reducing the size of the service metadata, a single parent Layer
    may enclose any number of additional layers, which may be hierarchically nested as desired. Some properties
    defined in a parent layer are inherited by the children it encloses. These inherited properties may be either
    redefined or added to by the child.</P>
    
    <P ALIGN="justify">A Map Server shall include at least one {@link org.opengis.layer.Layer} element for each
    map layer offered. If desired, layers may be repeated in different categories (i.e., enclosed in more than one
    parent {@code Layer}) when relevant.</P>
    
    <P ALIGN="justify">A list of keywords or keyword phrases describing each layer should be included to help catalogue
    searching. Each keyword may be accompanied by a "vocabulary" attribute to indicate the defining authority for the
    keyword. No controlled vocabulary of Layer and Style Names or Titles is defined by the International Standard, so
    they may be chosen at the discretion of the service provider organization or information community.</P>
