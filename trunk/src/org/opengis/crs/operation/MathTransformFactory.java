/**
 * Low level factory for creating {@linkplain MathTransform math transforms}.
 * Many high level GIS applications will never need to use this factory directly;
 * they can use a {@linkplain CoordinateOperationFactory coordinate operation factory}
 * instead. However, the <code>MathTransformFactory</code> interface can be used directly
 * by applications that wish to transform other types of coordinates (e.g. color coordinates,
 * or image pixel coordinates).
 * <br><br>
 * A {@linkplain MathTransform math transform} is an object that actually does
 * the work of applying formulae to coordinate values. The math transform does
 * not know or care how the coordinates relate to positions in the real world.
 * This lack of semantics makes implementing <code>MathTransformFactory</code>
 * significantly easier than it would be otherwise.
 *
 * For example the affine transform applies a matrix to the coordinates
 * without knowing how what it is doing relates to the real world. So if
 * the matrix scales <var>Z</var> values by a factor of 1000, then it could
 * be converting meters into millimeters, or it could be converting kilometers
 * into meters.
 * <br><br>
 * Because {@linkplain MathTransform math transforms} have low semantic value
 * (but high mathematical value), programmers who do not have much knowledge
 * of how GIS applications use coordinate systems, or how those coordinate
 * systems relate to the real world can implement <code>MathTransformFactory</code>.
 * The low semantic content of {@linkplain MathTransform math transforms} also
 * means that they will be useful in applications that have nothing to do with
 * GIS coordinates. For example, a math transform could be used to map color
 * coordinates between different color spaces, such as converting (red, green, blue)
 * colors into (hue, light, saturation) colors.
 * <br><br>
 * Since a {@linkplain MathTransform math transform} does not know what its source
 * and target coordinate systems mean, it is not necessary or desirable for a math
 * transform object to keep information on its source and target coordinate systems.
