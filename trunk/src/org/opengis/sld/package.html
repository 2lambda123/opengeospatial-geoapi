  Allows user-defined symbolization of feature data. The following is adapted from
  <A HREF="http://www.opengis.org/docs/02-070.pdf">OpenGIS&reg; Styled Layer Descriptor</A>
  specification.

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Package {@link org.opengis.layer} describes the appearance of a
  map in terms of <CITE>styled layers</CITE>. A styled layer can be considered as a
  transparent sheet with features symbolized upon it. A map is made up of a number of
  these styled layers put together in a specified order. The styled layers are said to
  be Z-ordered. Users can define more complex or simpler maps by adding or removing
  styled layers.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A styled layer itself represents a particular combination of
  <CITE>layer</CITE> and a <CITE>style</CITE> in which that layer can be symbolized.
  Conceptually, the layer defines a stream of features and the style defines how those
  features are symbolized. This concept is underlined by the fact that there may be multiple
  styles in which a layer can be symbolized.</P>
