  Gives a normalized interface to a data provider that can serve up collections
  of {@link org.opengis.feature.Feature} objects.
 
  <H3>Package Specification</H3>
  <P ALIGN="justify">This package is based on the following specifications:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Ref WFS spec for locking workflow</LI>
    <LI>Ref Catalog 2.0 spec for paging idea and QueryRequest paging idea</LI>
  </UL>

  <H3>WFS Long Transaction Support</H3>
  <p>
  The locking workflow described by FeatureCollection.lock() methods and LockRequest,
  and LockResponse, and indeed the Transaction facilities employed by FeatureCollection
  are informed by the requirements of the WFS specification.
  </p>
  <p>
  The WFS specification provides an attractive middle ground between full versioned
  Features, and light-weight inproccess or file lock based approaches. Locks
  are maintained for a requested duration. A successfult lock opperation results
  in a authorization token that may be used at a later time. A transaction
  may be assigned a token allowing it to work on previously locked features.
  WFS allows a lock to be taken out across multiple FeatureCollections in a single
  request. We have extended this idea to support FeatureCollection from different
  DataStores - although we confess that the authorization tokens are still on a 
  per DataStore basis.
