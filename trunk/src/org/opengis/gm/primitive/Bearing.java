 * Bearing is a data type used to represent direction in the coordinate reference system.
 * In a 2D coordinate reference system, this can be accomplished using a "angle measured
 * from true north" or a 2D vector point in that direction. In a 3D coordinate reference
 * system, two angles or any 3D vector is possible. If both a set of angles and a vector
 * are given, then they shall be consistent with one another.
