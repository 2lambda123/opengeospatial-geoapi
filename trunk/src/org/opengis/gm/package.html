  Root package for geometries. The following is adapted from
  <A HREF="http://www.opengis.org/docs/01-101.pdf">Feature Geometry
  (Topic 1)</A> specification.
  <P ALIGN="justify">A geometric object shall be a combination of a coordinate geometry and a coordinate
  reference system. In all of the operations, all geometric calculations shall be done in the coordinate
  reference system of the first geometric object accessed, which is normally the object whose operation
  is being invoked. Returned objects shall be in the coordinate reference system in which the calculations
  are done unless explicitly stated otherwise. The interface defined in this package are basically those
  of set theory. In general a geometric object is a set of geometric points, represented by
  {@link org.opengis.gm.geometry.DirectPosition}. Object instantiations of geometric objects are
  {@link org.opengis.gm.Geometry}. Object instantiations of geometric points, when used as values,
  are <CODE>DirectPosition</CODE>s. General set theory operations defined at <CODE>Geometry</CODE>
  differentiate further down the class hierarchy depending on whether or not the boundary
  <CODE>DirectPositions</CODE> are included as set elements. Subtypes of
  {@link org.opengis.gm.primitive.Primitive} do not contain boundary points, while subtypes of
  {@link org.opengis.gm.complex.Complex} do.</P>

  <P ALIGN="justify">{@link org.opengis.gm.Geometry} and {@link org.opengis.gm.primitive.Primitive}
  are purely abstract in the sense that no object or data structure from an application schema can
  instantiate them directly. Instances of these classes must be instances of one of their non-abstract
  subtypes, such as {@link org.opengis.gm.primitive.Point}, {@link org.opengis.gm.primitive.Curve}, or
  {@link org.opengis.gm.primitive.Surface}. This is not the case for {@link org.opengis.gm.complex.Complex},
  which can be directly instantiated by an application schema, and need not be an instance of one of the
  non-abstract subclasses of {@link org.opengis.gm.complex.Composite}.</P>
