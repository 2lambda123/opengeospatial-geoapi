  Description and storage of {@linkplain org.opengis.parameter.ParameterValue parameter values}.
  The following is adapted from
  <A HREF="http://www.opengis.org/docs/03-073r1.zip">OpenGIS&reg;
  Spatial Referencing by Coordinates (Topic 2)</A> specification.

  <P ALIGN="justify">Most {@linkplain org.opengis.parameter.ParameterValue parameter values} are
  numeric, but for some operation methods, notably those implementing a grid interpolation
  algorithm, the parameter value could be a file name and location (this may be a URI). An
  example is the coordinate transformation from NAD&nbsp;27 to NAD&nbsp;83 in the USA; depending
  on the locations of the points to be transformed, one of a series of grid files should be used.</P>

  <P ALIGN="justify">Some operation methods may require a large number of coordinate operation
  parameters. Also, some operation methods require that groups of parameters be repeatable as
  a group. In such cases, it is helpful to group related parameters in
  {@linkplain org.opengis.parameter.OperationParameterGroup parameter groups}. Two or more parameter
  groups are then associated with a particular operation method, and each parameter group consists
  of a set of {@linkplain org.opengis.parameter.OperationParameter operation parameters}, or other,
  nested parameter groups. This way of modelling is not mandatory; all coordinate operation
  parameters may be assigned directly to the coordinate operation method.</P>
  
  <h3>Shared Parameter API</h3>
  <p>
  We have extended the use of these Parameter classes to be shared across seveal
  implementations with different needs. This is purly an acident of impelemntation
  (we produced these parameter classes first. They do happen to be very expressive
  and a good candiate for reuse:
  </p>
  We also considered:
  <ul>
  <li>ISO 19119 - type specification in terms of ENUM, RANGE and so on. Not enough
      information is publically available to proceed.
  <li>Grid Coverage Exchange -
      parameter description is simple and has been superceeded by these definitions.
  <li>java.beans.ParameterDescriptor -
      The Java Beans specification is well known and many tools exist for UI creation
      based on this specification.
  <li>javax.jai.* -
      Java Advanced Imaging contains a PrameterDescriptor infrastructure that has
      served as a guideline for how we would like to extend this work.
  </ul>
  <p>
  In the field we are using this set of prameter classes to describe connection information
  for WMS, WFS and Database connections - a function that ISO 19119 - Metadata Services is
  supposed to fufill. In this we can only point to our desire

  <h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
  
  <h3>Intergration with Java Collections API</h3>
  
  The following simplification may obtainable
  <h2>Package Specification</h2>

	This package is based on the following specifications:
    <ul>
    <li>  <A HREF="http://www.opengis.org/docs/03-073r1.zip">
        OpenGIS&reg; Spatial Referencing by Coordinates (Topic 2)</A> specification.
    </ul>

  <p>
  Q: Is practice of creating objects for MetadataEntity, Element and EntityType not in the spirit of the specification, if so can they recommend an alternative? One alternative would be to port the CORBA IDL from v2. Problem is InsertMetadata/UpdateMetadata using "any payload".
