    An <CITE>expression</CITE> is a combination of one or more elements that
    evaluate to single {@link Object} value. The following is adapted from
    <A HREF="http://www.opengis.org/docs/02-059.pdf">Filter encoding implementation</A>:

    <P ALIGN="justify">An <CITE>expression</CITE> can be formed using the elements:
    {@ling org.opengis.filter.expression.Add}, {@ling org.opengis.filter.expression.Substract},
    {@ling org.opengis.filter.expression.Multiply}, {@ling org.opengis.filter.expression.Divide},
    {@ling org.opengis.filter.expression.PropertyName}, {@ling org.opengis.filter.expression.Literal}
    and {@ling org.opengis.filter.expression.Function}. They all belong to the substitution group
    expression which means that any of them can be used wherever an expression is called for. In addition,
    the combinaison of these elements are themselves expressions and can be used wherever an expression is
    called for.</P>

    <H3>Arithmetic operators</H3>
    <P ALIGN="justify">The elements defined in this package are used to encode the fundamental arithmetic
    operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Arithmetic operators are binary
    operators meaning that they accept two arguments and evaluate to a single result.</P>

    <H3>Literals</H3>
    <P ALIGN="justify">A literal value is any part of a statement or expression that is to
    be used exactly as it is specified, rather than as a variable or other element. The
    {@link org.opengis.filter.expression.Literal} element is used to encode literal scalar
    and geometric values.</P>

    <H3>Functions</H3>
    <P ALIGN="justify">A function is a named procedure that performs a distinct computation.
    A function may accept zero or more arguments as input and generates a single result. A
    function is composed of the name of the function, encoded using the attribute name, and
    zero or more arguments contained within the {@link org.opengis.filter.expression.Function}
    element. The arguments themselves are {@linkplain org.opengis.filter.expression.Expression expressions}.</P>
