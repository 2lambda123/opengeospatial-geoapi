GeoAPI snapshot

   Contains interfaces under development for possible inclusion in a future GeoAPI release.
   Changes need to be submitted to OGC before to be included in an official release (probably
   3.0). Releases in the 2.x series (except 2.0.0) are milestones.

   A page listing the GeoAPI content (interface and method names) together with the name used
   in the OGC and ISO specifications is available {{{content.html}here}}.
