/**
 * Defines the structure and content of views of real-world phenomenon.
 * A feature acts as a model of a real world entity. As such it has many similarities to object oriented programming
 * ideas of classes, fields and methods:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.opengis.feature.FeatureType} defines a data structure (similar to {@link java.lang.Class} in Java).
 *     Features can contain three kinds of properties:
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>{@link org.opengis.feature.AttributeType} holds information about an attribute
 *           (similar to a {@link java.lang.reflect.Field} in Java).</li>
 *       <li>{@link org.opengis.feature.FeatureAssociationRole} defines a relationship a {@code Feature} is involved in
 *           (aggregation, composition, <i>etc.</i>).</li>
 *       <li>{@link org.opengis.feature.FeatureOperation} describes functionality a feature is able to perform
 *           (similar to {@link java.lang.reflect.Method} in Java).</li>
 *     </ul>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * An important aspect of a {@code Feature} is the fact that it is a dynamic data construct defined at runtime.
 * Traditionally the Java programming language represents dynamic data structures using {@link java.util.Map}.
 * One could think of a {@code Feature} as a {@code java.util.Map} in which the keys (i.e. the property names)
 * are well defined.
 *
 * <p>Feature types model is described in the {@linkplain org.opengis.annotation.Specification#ISO_19109 ISO 19109}
 * specification. The following table shows the class hierarchy:</p>
 *
 * <table class="ogc">
 * <caption>Feature class hierarchy</caption>
 * <tr>
 *   <th>Types (from ISO 19109)</th>
 *   <th class="sep">Instances (GeoAPI specific)</th>
