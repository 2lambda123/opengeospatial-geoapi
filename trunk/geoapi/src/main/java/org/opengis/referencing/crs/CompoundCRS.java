/**
 * A coordinate reference system describing the position of points through two or more
 * independent coordinate reference systems. Thus it is associated with two or more
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.cs.CoordinateSystem Coordinate Systems} and
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.datum.Datum Datums} by defining the compound CRS
 * as an ordered set of two or more instances of {@link CoordinateReferenceSystem}.
 * <p>
 * In general, a Compound CRS may contain any number of axes. The Compound CRS contains an
 * ordered set of coordinate reference systems and the tuple order of a compound coordinate
 * set shall follow that order, while the subsets of the tuple, described by each of the
 * composing coordinate reference systems, follow the tuple order valid for their respective
 * coordinate reference systems.
 * <p>
 * For spatial coordinates, a number of constraints exist for the construction of Compound CRSs.
 * For example, the coordinate reference systems that are combined should not contain any duplicate
 * or redundant axes. Valid combinations include:
 * <p>
 * <UL>
 *   <LI>Geographic 2D + Vertical</LI>
 *   <LI>Geographic 2D + Engineering 1D (near vertical)</LI>
 *   <LI>Projected + Vertical</LI>
 *   <LI>Projected + Engineering 1D (near vertical)</LI>
 *   <LI>Engineering (horizontal 2D or 1D linear) + Vertical</LI>
 * </UL>
 * <p>
 * Any coordinate reference system, or any of the above listed combinations of coordinate
 * reference systems, can have a Temporal CRS added. More than one Temporal CRS may be added
 * if these axes represent different time quantities. For example, the oil industry sometimes
 * uses "4D seismic", by which is meant seismic data with the vertical axis expressed in
 * milliseconds (signal travel time). A second time axis indicates how it changes with time
 * (years), e.g. as a reservoir is gradually exhausted of its recoverable oil or gas).

     *    According ISO 19111, "<cite>A Compound CRS is a coordinate reference system that combines
     *    two or more coordinate reference systems, <u>none of which can itself be compound</u></cite>".
     *    However this constraint greatly increases the cost of extracting metadata (especially the CRS
     *    identifier) of the three-dimensional part of a spatio-temporal CRS. Note also that in
     *    "<u>Coordinate Transformation Services</u>" (OGC document 01-009), a compound CRS was
     *    specified as a pair of arbitrary CRS ("head" and "tail") where each could be another
     *    compound CRS, allowing the creation of a tree. GeoAPI follows that more general strategy.
