GeoAPI build tools

  Javadoc taglets and annotation processing tools for processing GeoAPI
  after compilation. Those tools are used mostly for javadoc generation.
  They are internal to the GeoAPI project and may change at any time.

  The steps for creating a GeoAPI milestone are documentes in a separated page:

    * {{{./release-instruction.html}Steps for creating a GeoAPI milestone in a Unix environment}}


* Creating the GeoAPI bundles

  This module contains a Unix shell script for generating a ZIP files with the following content:

    * <<<geoapi-conformance.pack.gz>>> containing the {{{../geoapi-conformance/index.html}GeoAPI
      conformance}} JAR file together with its dependencies (<<<geoapi-pending>>>, JUnit and Unit
      of measurement).

    * <<<geoapi-proj4.jar>>> for testing the conformance tests application.

    * <<<LICENSE.txt>>> and <<<README.txt>>> files.

  To create the bundle, execute the following command from the root of the GeoAPI project:

-------------------------------------
tools/src/main/shell/pack.sh
-------------------------------------


* Documenting the API changes

  This module contains a <<<jdiff>>> directory, which is not used by the normal build process.
  The <<<jdiff>>> directory allows the generation of HTML pages documenting the API changes
  between the latest GeoAPI stable release and the current development (trunk). To generate
  those pages, invoke the <<<jdiff.sh>>> script from any directory. There is no configuration
  required - it should work <out of the box> on Unix machine with JDK6, and can be invoked
  from a continuous integration tool.

  The <<<jdiff.sh>>> script must be invoked explicitely - it is not invoked by the Maven build
  process. It shall be invoked after <<<mvn install site>>> and before <<<mvn site:deploy>>>,
  like below:

-------------------------------------
mvn install site
tools/jdiff/jdiff.sh
mvn site:deploy
-------------------------------------

  The HTML pages are deployed on
  {{{http://www.geoapi.org/changes/snapshot/changes.html}http://www.geoapi.org/changes/snapshot/}}.


** Credit

  The <<<jdiff.jar>>> file is derived from the {{{http://jdiff.sourceforge.net/}JDiff}} project,
  with the following slight modifications:

    * Background color changed from blue to white.

    * <<<\{@linkplain\}>>> annotations handled in the same way than <<<\{@link\}>>>.

    * Disabled the breaking of long sentences on two rows, since it made the changes
      more difficult to read.
