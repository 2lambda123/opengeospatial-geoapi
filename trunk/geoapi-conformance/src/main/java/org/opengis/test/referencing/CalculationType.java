/**
 * The kind of calculation that produced the {@link DirectPosition}s being compared.
 * This enumeration is expected by all {@link assertCoordinateEquals(...)} methods in the
 * {@link TransformTestCase} class. The enumeration values are consumed by the following
 * methods:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link TransformTestCase#normalize(DirectPosition, DirectPosition, CalculationType)}</li>
 *   <li>{@link TransformTestCase#tolerance(DirectPosition, int, CalculationType)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The above methods are hooks for implementors. Subclasses can override those methods for
 * controlling the {@linkplain TransformTestCase#tolerance tolerance} threshold on a case-by-case
 * basis. For example when testing the conversions from a geographic CRS (axes in degrees) to a
 * projected CRS (axes in metres), a precision of 10 centimetres can be requested by setting the
 * {@link TransformTestCase#tolerance} value to 0.1. However when testing the inverse transform,
 * the tolerance threshold must be converted to decimal degrees, which is approximatively 1E-6Â°
 * for the above-cited precision.
