/**
 * Identification of a subset of resources from a collection of resources
 * whose property values satisfy a set of logically connected predicates.
 * Often a filter is used to define a set of {@link Feature} instances that are to be operated upon.
 * The operating set can be comprised of one or more enumerated features or a set of features defined by
 * specifying spatial and non-spatial constraints on the geometric and scalar properties of a {@link FeatureType}.
 *
 * <p>Roughly speaking, a filter encodes the information present in the {@code WHERE} clause of a SQL statement.
 * There are various sub-interfaces of this interface that represent many types of filters,
 * such as simple property comparisons or spatial queries.</p>
 *
 * <p>The second use of {@code Filter} focuses on expressing constraints (or Facets).
 * This use places restrictions on the allowable and is captured as part of schema information {@link FeatureType}.
 * This is similar to the XML concept of "facets".</p>
 *
 * <h2>Parameter types</h2>
 * Filters are typically used for filtering feature instances.
 * In such case, the {@code <R>} type parameter should be {@link org.opengis.feature.Feature}.
 * However it is legal to use filters for other kinds of resources, for example coverage's geometry-value pairs.
 * The latter are sometime considered as a kind of features.
 *
 * <p>The value of {@code <? super R>} can be obtained at runtime by a call to {@link #getResourceClass()}.</p>

 *
 * @param  <R>  the type of resources (e.g. {@link org.opengis.feature.Feature}) to filter.
 *
 * @departure easeOfUse
 *   In ISO specification, {@code Filter} contains a "filter" property of type {@code Operator}.
 *   Then various {@code Operator} subclasses are provided such as {@code SpatialOperator}, <i>etc.</i>
 *   GeoAPI removes this indirection level and extends {@code Filter} directly instead.
