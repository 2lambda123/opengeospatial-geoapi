     * Core metadata elements required to identify a dataset, typically for catalogue purposes.
     * This level specifies metadata elements answering the following questions:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Does a dataset on a specific topic exist (what)?</li>
     *   <li>For a specific place (where)?</li>
     *   <li>For a specific date or period (when)?</li>
     *   <li>A point of contact to learn more about or order the dataset (who)?</li>
     * </ul>

     * Using the recommended {@linkplain Obligation#OPTIONAL optional} elements in addition to the
     * {@linkplain Obligation#MANDATORY mandatory} elements will increase inter-operability,
     * allowing users to understand without ambiguity the geographic data and the related metadata
     * provided by either the producer or the distributor.
