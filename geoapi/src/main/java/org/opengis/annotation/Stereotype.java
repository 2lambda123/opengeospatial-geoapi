/**
 * Type of modeling element as declared in the OGC/ISO UML diagram.
 * Values of this enumeration are associated to GeoAPI interfaces by the {@link Classifier}
 * annotation.
 *
 * <p>This enumeration is closely related to the ISO 19115 {@link org.opengis.metadata.Datatype} code list,
 * but not identical since ISO 19115 specifies <i>datatype</i> and <i>stereotype</i> as two distinct information.
 * Furthermore, {@code Stereotype} needs to be defined as an {@code Enum} for allowing usages in Java annotations</p>
 *
 * <p>This enumeration does not include the <i>code list</i> and <i>enumeration</i> stereotypes,
 * because instances of those types are identified by the {@link org.opengis.util.CodeList} and
 * {@link Enum} base classes respectively.</p>
