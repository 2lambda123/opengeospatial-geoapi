/**
 * A type consisting of either a {@linkplain DirectPosition direct position} or of a
 * {@linkplain Point point} from which a {@linkplain DirectPosition direct position}
 * shall be obtained. The use of this data type allows the identification of a position
 * either directly as a coordinate (variant direct) or indirectly as a {@linkplain Point point}
 * (variant indirect).
 *
 * @departure constraint
 *   ISO 19107 defines <code>Position</code> as a <code>union</code> of
 *   <code>DirectPosition</code> and <code>Point</code> but unions are not allowed in Java.
 *   GeoAPI defines <code>Position</code> as the base interface of both types so the two
 *   conditional accessor methods, <code>getPoint()</code> and <code>getDirectPosition()</code>,
 *   can be replaced by an <code>instanceof</code> check. However, the
 *   <code>getDirectPosition()</code> has been retained with different semantics, conceptually
 *   returning a <code>DirectPosition</code> at the same location. The conditionality has also
 *   been changed to mandatory since all three types conceptually have a well defined location.
