/**
 * A set of base types from {@linkplain org.opengis.annotation.Specification#ISO_19103 ISO 19103}
 * which can not be mapped directly from Java, plus utilities.
 *
 * <h3>Names and Namespaces</h3>
 * <p align="justify">The job of a "name" in the context of ISO 19103 is to associate that name
 * with an {@link java.lang.Object}.  Examples given are <cite>objects</cite>: which form namespaces
 * for their attributes, and <cite>Schema</cite>: which form namespaces for their components.
 * A straightforward and natural use of the namespace structure defined in 19103 is the translation
 * of given names into specific storage formats.  XML has different naming rules than shapefiles,
 * and both are different than NetCDF.  This common framework can easily be harnessed to impose
 * constraints specific to a particular application without requiring that a separate implementation
 * of namespaces be provided for each format.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Records and Schemas</h3>
 * <p align="justify">Records and Schemas are similar to a {@code struct} in C/C++, a table in SQL,
 * a {@code RECORD} in Pascal, or an attribute-only class in Java if it were stripped of all notions
 * of inheritance.  They are organized into named collections called Schemas. Both records and schemas
 * behave as dictionaries for their members and are similar to "packages" in Java.</p>
