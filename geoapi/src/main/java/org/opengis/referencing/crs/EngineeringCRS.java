/**
 * A 1-, 2- or 3-dimensional contextually local coordinate reference system.
 * It can be divided into two broad categories:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>earth-fixed systems applied to engineering activities on or near the surface of the earth;</li>
 *   <li>CRSs on moving platforms such as road vehicles, vessels, aircraft, or spacecraft.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Earth-fixed Engineering CRSs are commonly based on a simple flat-earth approximation of the
 * earth's surface, and the effect of earth curvature on feature geometry is ignored: calculations
 * on coordinates use simple plane arithmetic without any corrections for earth curvature. The
 * application of such Engineering CRSs to relatively small areas and "contextually local" is in
 * this case equivalent to "spatially local".
 *
 * <p>Engineering CRSs used on moving platforms are usually intermediate coordinate reference
 * systems that are computationally required to calculate coordinates referenced to
 * {@linkplain GeocentricCRS geocentric}, {@linkplain GeographicCRS geographic} or
 * {@linkplain ProjectedCRS projected} CRSs. These engineering coordinate reference
 * systems are subject to all the motions of the platform with which they are associated.
 * In this case "contextually local" means that the associated coordinates are meaningful
 * only relative to the moving platform. Earth curvature is usually irrelevant and is therefore
 * ignored. In the spatial sense their applicability may extend from the immediate vicinity of
 * the platform (e.g. a moving seismic ship) to the entire earth (e.g. in space applications).
 * The determining factor is the mathematical model deployed in the positioning calculations.
 * Transformation of coordinates from these moving Engineering CRSs to earth-referenced coordinate
 * reference systems involves time-dependent coordinate operation parameters.</p>
 *
 * <p>This type of CRS can be used with coordinate systems of type
 * {@link org.opengis.referencing.cs.AffineCS},
 * {@link org.opengis.referencing.cs.CartesianCS},
 * {@link org.opengis.referencing.cs.CylindricalCS},
 * {@link org.opengis.referencing.cs.LinearCS},
 * {@link org.opengis.referencing.cs.PolarCS},
 * {@link org.opengis.referencing.cs.SphericalCS},
 * {@link org.opengis.referencing.cs.UserDefinedCS}.</p>
