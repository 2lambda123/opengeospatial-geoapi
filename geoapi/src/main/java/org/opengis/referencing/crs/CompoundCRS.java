/**
 * A coordinate reference system describing the position of points through two or more
 * independent coordinate reference systems. Thus it is indirectly associated with two
 * or more {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.cs.CoordinateSystem coordinate systems}
 * and {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.datum.Datum datums} by defining the compound
 * CRS as an ordered set of two or more instances of {@link CoordinateReferenceSystem}.
 *
 * <p>For spatial coordinates, a number of constraints exist for the construction of Compound CRSs.
 * For example, the coordinate reference systems that are combined should not contain any duplicate
 * or redundant axes. Valid combinations include:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Geographic 2D + Vertical</li>
 *   <li>Geographic 2D + Engineering 1D (near vertical)</li>
 *   <li>Projected + Vertical</li>
 *   <li>Projected + Engineering 1D (near vertical)</li>
 *   <li>Engineering (horizontal 2D or 1D linear) + Vertical</li>
 *   <li>Engineering (1D linear) + Vertical</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Any coordinate reference system, or any of the above listed combinations of coordinate reference systems,
 * can have a {@link TemporalCRS} added. More than one temporal CRS may be added if these axes represent
 * different time quantities. For example, the oil industry sometimes uses "4D seismic", by which is meant
 * seismic data with the vertical axis expressed in milliseconds (signal travel time). A second time axis
 * indicates how it changes with time (years), e.g. as a reservoir is gradually exhausted of its recoverable
 * oil or gas.

     *   ISO 19111 said <q>nesting of compound CRSs shall not be permitted; the individual single systems

     *   a temporal CRS to an existing three-dimensional compound CRS without loosing the name and identifiers
     *   of the 3D CRS, unless nesting is permitted. It is programmatically easier to convert nested CRSs to a
     *   flat list of single CRSs when needed than to reconstruct the 3D CRS from the single components.
     *   Consequently, GeoAPI has been keep conformant with the legacy OGC 01-009 specification in this aspect,
     *   which were allowing nested compound CRS.
