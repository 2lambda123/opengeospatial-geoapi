/**
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.cs.CoordinateSystem Coordinate systems} and their
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.cs.CoordinateSystemAxis axis}. The following is adapted from
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.annotation.Specification#ISO_19111 OpenGISÂ® Spatial Referencing by
 * Coordinates (Topic 2)} specification.
 *
 * <p>A coordinate system shall be composed of a non-repeating sequence of coordinate system axes.
 * One {@link org.opengis.referencing.cs.CoordinateSystem} (CS) instance may be used by multiple
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.crs.CoordinateReferenceSystem} (CRS) instances.
 * The dimension of the coordinate space, the names, the units of measure, the directions
 * and sequence of the axes shall be part of the coordinate system definition.
 * The number of axes shall be equal to the dimension of the space of which it describes the geometry.
 * It is therefore not permitted to supply a coordinate tuple with two heights of different definition.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@linkplain org.opengis.geometry.DirectPosition#getDimension() number of coordinates} in a coordinate tuple
 * shall be equal to the {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.cs.CoordinateSystem#getDimension() number of coordinate
 * axes} in the coordinate system. Coordinates in coordinate tuples shall be supplied in the order in which
 * the coordinate system's axes are defined.</p>
 *
 * <p>A coordinate system implies how coordinates are calculated from geometric elements such as distances
 * and angles and vice versa. The calculus required to derive angles and distances from point coordinates
 * and vice versa in a map plane is simple Euclidean 2D arithmetic. To do the same on the surface of an
 * ellipsoid (curved 2D space) involves more complex ellipsoidal calculus. These rules cannot be specified
 * in detail, but are implied in the geometric properties of the coordinate space.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Coordinate system types and unions</h2>
 * <p>Coordinate systems are divided into subtypes by the geometric properties of the coordinate space spanned
 * and the geometric properties of the axes themselves (straight or curved; perpendicular or not).
 * Certain subtypes of coordinate system shall be used only with specific subtypes of coordinate reference system.
 * The restrictions are documented in the javadoc of each CRS subtype.</p>
 *
 * <p>ISO 19111 defines three coordinate system <em>unions</em> in addition to the coordinate system <em>types</em>.
 * Each union enumerates the coordinate system types that can be associated to a CRS type.
 * However, the {@code union} construct found in some languages like C/C++ is not available in Java.
 * GeoAPI workarounds this limitation in different ways:</p>

 *   ISO 19111 defines {@code GeodeticCS}, {@code EngineeringCS} and {@code ImageCS} unions.
 *   However, the {@code union} construct found in some languages like C/C++ is not available in Java.
 *   For each union, a different approach has been applied and documented in the {@code org.opengis.referencing.cs}
 *   package. In the particular case of {@code ImageCS}, the same type-safety objective can be obtained
 *   through a slight change in the interface hierarchy.
