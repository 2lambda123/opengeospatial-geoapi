/**
 * A one-dimensional coordinate system used to record the heights (or depths) of points. Such a
 * coordinate system is usually dependent on the Earth's gravity field, perhaps loosely as when
 * atmospheric pressure is the basis for the vertical coordinate system axis. An exact definition
 * is deliberately not provided as the complexities of the subject fall outside the scope of this
 * specification. A {@code VerticalCS} shall have one {@linkplain #getAxis axis association}.
