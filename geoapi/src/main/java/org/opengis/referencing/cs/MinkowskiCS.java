/**
 * A 4-dimensional spatio-temporal coordinate system with time expressed as lengths.
 * The three spacial dimensions give the position of points relative to orthogonal straight axes.
 * The fourth dimension gives the position in time since an epoch.
 * All axes shall have the same length unit of measure,
 * with time expressed as the distance covered by light in the vacuum during the elapsed time.
 *
 * <p>This type of CS can be used by coordinate reference systems of type
 * {@link org.opengis.referencing.crs.InertialCRS} or
 * {@link org.opengis.referencing.crs.EngineeringCRS}.</p>
