/**
 * Datum ensemble.
 *
 * A datum ensemble is a construct to facilitate the merging of realizations of the same reference system
 * for lower accuracy manipulation. A datum ensemble is a collection of two or more reference frames that
 * are realizations of one Terrestrial or Vertical Reference System and which for all but the highest
 * accuracy requirements may be considered to be insignificantly different from each other.
 * Datasets referenced to the various realizations may be merged without change of coordinates.
 *
 * <h2>Constraints</h2>
 * If the datums specify a {@linkplain Datum#getConventionalRS() conventional reference system} (<abbr>RS</abbr>),
 * then all datums in a datum ensemble shall have the same conventional <abbr>RS</abbr>.
 *

 * @version 3.1
 *
 * @param <D> the type of datum contained in this ensemble.
