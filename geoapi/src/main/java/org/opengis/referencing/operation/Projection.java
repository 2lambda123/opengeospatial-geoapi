/**
 * A {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.operation.Conversion conversion} transforming
 * (<var>longitude</var>,<var>latitude</var>) coordinates to cartesian coordinates
 * (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>). Although some map projections can be represented as a
 * geometric process, in general a map projection is a set of formulae that converts geodetic
 * latitude and longitude to plane (map) coordinates. Height plays no role in this process,
 * which is entirely two-dimensional. The same map projection can be applied to many
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.crs.GeographicCRS geographic CRSs}, resulting in many
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.crs.ProjectedCRS projected CRSs} each of which is related
 * to the same {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.datum.GeodeticDatum geodetic datum} as the
 * geographic CRS on which it was based.
 * <P>
 * An unofficial list of projections and their parameters can
 * be found <A HREF="http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/proj_list/">there</A>.
 * Most projections expect the following parameters:
 *  <code>"semi_major"</code> (mandatory),
 *  <code>"semi_minor"</code> (mandatory),
 *  <code>"central_meridian"</code> (default to 0),
 *  <code>"latitude_of_origin"</code> (default to 0),
 *  <code>"scale_factor"</code> (default to 1),
 *  <code>"false_easting"</code> (default to 0) and
 *  <code>"false_northing"</code> (default to 0).
 *
 * @departure extension
 *   This interface is not part of the ISO specification. It has been added in GeoAPI at user
 *   request, in order to provide a way to know the kind of map projection.
