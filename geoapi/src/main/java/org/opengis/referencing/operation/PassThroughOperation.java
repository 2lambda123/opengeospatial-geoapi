/**
 * An operation specifying a subset of a coordinate tuple subjected to a specific coordinate operation.
 * Coordinates in the coordinate tuple other than the subset remain unchanged.
 * For example, it may be required to transform only the horizontal or only the vertical component of
 * a compound three-dimensional coordinate reference system (<abbr>CRS</abbr>).
 * This operation specifies what subset of a coordinate tuple is subject to a requested operation.
 * It takes the form of referencing another coordinate operation and specifying a sequence of numbers
 * defining the positions in the coordinate tuple of the coordinates affected by that operation.
 * The order of the coordinates in a coordinate tuple shall agree with the order of the coordinate system
 * axes as defined for the associated coordinate system.
