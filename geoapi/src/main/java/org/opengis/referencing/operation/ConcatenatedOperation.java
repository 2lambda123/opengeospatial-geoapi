/**
 * An ordered sequence of two or more single coordinate operations.
 * The sequence of operations is constrained by the requirement that the source coordinate reference system
 * of step (<var>n</var>+1) must be the same as the target coordinate reference system of step (<var>n</var>).
 * The source coordinate reference system of the first step and the target coordinate reference system of the
 * last step are the source and target coordinate reference system associated with the concatenated operation.
 * Instead of a forward operation, an inverse operation may be used for one or more of the operation steps
 * mentioned above, if the inverse operation is uniquely defined by the forward operation.
 *
 * <p>The concatenated coordinate operation class is primarily intended to provide a mechanism that forces
 * application software to use a preferred path to go from source to target coordinate reference system,
 * if a direct transformation between the two is not available.</p>
