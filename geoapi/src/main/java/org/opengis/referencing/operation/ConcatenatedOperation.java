/**
 * An ordered sequence of two or more single coordinate operations. The sequence of operations is
 * constrained by the requirement that the source coordinate reference system of step
 * (<var>n</var>+1) must be the same as the target coordinate reference system of step
 * (<var>n</var>). The source coordinate reference system of the first step and the target
 * coordinate reference system of the last step are the source and target coordinate reference
 * system associated with the concatenated operation. Instead of a forward operation, an inverse
 * operation may be used for one or more of the operation steps mentioned above, if the inverse
 * operation is uniquely defined by the forward operation.
