/**
 * Javadoc taglets and annotation processing tools for processing GeoAPI after compilation.
 * Those tools are used mostly for javadoc generation.
 * Some services offered by this module are:
 *
 * <ul class="verbose">
 *   <li><b>Generating API index page:</b>
 *     A summary of all types and members can be generated by the
 *     {@link org.opengis.tools.apt.IndexGenerator} processor.</li>
 *   <li><b>Documenting a summary of API changes:</b>
 *     A summary of API changes can be generated by the
 *     {@link org.opengis.tools.version.ChangeReport} class.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Usage instructions from command-line are in the
 * <a href="https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoapi/tree/master/tools">README.md</a> file.
