 * repeated linear graphic is plotted linearly and has its graphic symbol bent around the curves
 * of the line string, and a graphic fill has the pixels of the line rendered with a repeating
 * area-fill pattern. If neither a {@link #getGraphicFill GraphicFill} nor {@link #getGraphicStroke
 * GraphicStroke} element is given, then the line symbolizer will render a solid color.
