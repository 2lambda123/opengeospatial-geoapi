/**
 * Description of how a feature is to appear on a map.
 * A symbolizer describes how the shape should appear,
 * together with graphical properties such as color and opacity.
 * A symbolizer is obtained by specifying one of a small number of different types
 * and then supplying parameters to override its default behaviour.
 * The predefined type of symbolizers are
 * {@linkplain LineSymbolizer line},
 * {@linkplain PolygonSymbolizer polygon},
 * {@linkplain PointSymbolizer point},
 * {@linkplain TextSymbolizer text}, and
 * {@linkplain RasterSymbolizer raster}.
 *
 * <h2>Particular cases if the geometry is not the defined type of the symbolizer</h2>
 * Geometry types other than inherently linear types can also be used. If a point geometry is
 * used, it should be interpreted as a line of "epsilon" (arbitrarily small) length with a
 * horizontal orientation centered on the point, and should be rendered with two end caps.
 * If a polygon is used (or other "area" type), then its closed outline is used as the line string
 * (with no end caps). If a raster geometry is used, its coverage-area outline is used for the
 * line, rendered with no end caps.
