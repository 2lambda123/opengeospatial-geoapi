/**
 * Describes an element of a set that defines the relationships of a
 * {@linkplain DiscreteCoverage discrete coverage}. Each member of this class consists of two parts:
 * a {@linkplain DomainObject domain object} from the domain of the coverage to which it belongs and
 * a record of feature attribute values from the range of the coverage to which it belongs.
 * <var>geometry</var>-<var>value</var> pairs may be generated in the execution of an
 * {@link Coverage#evaluate(DirectPosition,Collection) evaluate} operation, and need not be
 * persistent. {@code GeometryValuePair} is subclassed to restrict the pairing of a feature
 * attribute value record to a specific subtype of domain object.
