/**
 * Base classes for validators and test suites for all GeoAPI objects. The

 * used for validating existing instances of various kind. Those methods can be conveniently
 * imported in a test class with the following Java statement:
 *
 * <blockquote><code>
 * import static org.opengis.test.Validators.*;
 * </code></blockquote>
 *
 * <p>No other validator class need to be considered, unless the validation process needs
