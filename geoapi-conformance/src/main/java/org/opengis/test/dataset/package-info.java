 * Provides small test data files together with verification methods for applications reading those data.
 * The test files are less than 15 kilobytes since their purpose is not to test implementation scalability.
 * The test files are intentionally simple, sometimes with only a subset of the metadata found in the field,
 * for making easier for application developers to use them in a debugging session.
