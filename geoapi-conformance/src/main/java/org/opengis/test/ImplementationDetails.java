/**
 * Provides optional information about the implementation being tested. Implementers can
 * provide an instance of this interface in their test packages and declare their instance
 * in the {@code META-INF/services/org.opengis.test.ImplementationDetails} file. GeoAPI
 * will iterate over every {@code ImplementationDetails} found on the classpath when needed:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Before each execution of a configurable {@link TestCase}, in order to check which tests
 *   (if any) should be disabled.</li>
 *
 *   <li>Before each execution of a {@link TestCase} performing numerical calculation, in
 *   order to determine if a specific implementation needs to relax the tolerance threshold.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * If no instance of {@code ImplementationDetails} is registered, then GeoAPI assumes that
 * all tests are enabled with their default tolerance threshold. This is equivalent to using
 * an {@code ImplementationDetails} instance where every methods return {@code null}.
