Milestone 2.1 of GeoAPI contains the interfaces developed by the GeoAPI project
but never formalized in any standards document.
This milestone came in two flavors: `geoapi-nogenerics-*.jar` required
a Java environment J2SE 1.4 or higher while `geoapi-*.jar` required a
Java environment Java 5 or higher, where the asterisk is a wildcard.
