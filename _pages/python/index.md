# Python API

There is no formal release of GeoAPI in Python yet, but the development files can be downloaded
[from GitHub](https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoapi/tree/master/geoapi/src/main/python/opengis)
for testing purposes.
Those interfaces may change at anytime before release.
The Python API is targeted for release in GeoAPI 4.0.
See the [GeoAPI developments](../snapshot/index.html) page for more information.
