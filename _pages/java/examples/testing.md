# Testing with GeoAPI

The implementation examples given in `geoapi-example` module are accompanied by JUnit tests,
with some of them built on top of [conformance tests](../../conformance/index.html).
Example test is available in the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoapi/tree/master/geoapi-examples/src/test/java/org/opengis/example).
