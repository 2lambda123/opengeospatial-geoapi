# Java API

Java interfaces are provided in [release 3.0.2](../3.0/index.html) of GeoAPI,
which can be downloaded from
[Maven Central Repository](https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=geoapi&namespace=org.opengis)
with the following coordinates:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.opengis</groupId>
    <artifactId>geoapi</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.2</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

The [Javadoc](../3.0/javadoc/index.html) is available online.

The [usage examples](examples/index.html) provide starting points
for applying coordinate operations (e.g. map projections) and
for fetching some metadata.

## Future work

Upgrade to latest standard versions,
Python interfaces and bridge between Java and Python are in progress.
This work is described in [GeoAPI developments](../snapshot/index.html) page.
