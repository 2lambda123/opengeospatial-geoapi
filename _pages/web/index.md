# Web API

Geospatial <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> for the web are developed
inside <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> by working groups other than GeoAPI.
Those web <abbr>API</abbr> are defined using OpenAPI.
There is not yet a connection between OpenAPI and GeoAPI, but it may happen in the future.
